# Simple brutalist website for storing recipes

### Why?
Over the years I have lost a lot of good recipes by not keeping track of the info properly.
Links rot, notes get lost and sadly, your mom won't be around forever to teach you again how to make salmorejo. So I created this site to write down all the recipes I can for future reference.

I may or may not set up an actual public website for everyone to learn, and so may you. **Feel free to use this as a template for storing or publising your own recipes**
