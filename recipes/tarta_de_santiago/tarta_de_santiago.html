		Delicious Spanish almond cake. It is super easy to make, with only 3 main ingredients. I always feel this type of cake is just perfect for the holiday season.
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>3 eggs: </b></li>Good quality, medium size.
			<li><b>3/4 cup sugar (150g): </b></li>You go a bit higher or lower to suit your taste.
			<li><b>1/2 cup almond flour (150g): </b></li>Use good quality almonds, since it is the main ingredient.
			<li><b>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon powder: </b></li>It makes the cake real comfy.
			<li><b>Zest of 1 lemon and 1 clementine: </b></li>It gives the cake a small citrus flavor.
			<li><b>Icing sugar: </b></li>For dusting the top once it is baked.
		</ul>
		<br>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Add eggs and sugar into a bowl and whisk until the mixture turns pale.</li>
			<li>Add the rest of the ingredients, except for icing sugar and using a spatula, gently fold everything until well combine.</li>
			<li>Pour batter into a 7 inch (18 cm) springform pan that has been buttered and floured. Bake in a preheated oven at 360ºF (180ºC) for 40 minutes or until golden brown and fully cooked.</li>
			<li>Cool completely. Place the Santiago cross cut out on top and dust generous amount of icing sugar all over the cake. Carefully remove the cut out. Slice and serve.</li>
			<li>Enjoy!</li>
		</ol>
